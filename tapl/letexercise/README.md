11 Simple Extensions
--------------------

Exercise [Recommended, ★★★]:  The letexercise typechecker (available at the book’s web site) is an incomplete implementation of let expressions: ba- sic parsing and printing functions are provided, but the clauses for TmLet are missing from the eval1 and typeof functions (in their place, you’ll ﬁnd dummy clauses that match everything and crash the program with an assertion failure). Finish it.
