fullfomsub
===========

26 Bounded Quantification
-------------------------

The system studied in most of this chapter is pure F<: (Figure 26-1). The examples also use records (11-7) and numbers (8-2). The associated OCaml implementations are fullfsub and fullfomsub. (The fullfsub checker suï¬ƒces for most of the examples; fullfomsub is needed for the ones involving type abbreviations with parameters, such as Pair.)

31 Higher-Order Subtyping
--------------------------

The associated OCaml implementation is fomsub (the fullfomsub implementation includes various extensions such as existentials).
