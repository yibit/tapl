9 Simply Typed Lambda-Calculus
-------------------------------

The system studied in this chapter is the simply typed lambda-calculus (Figure 9-1) with booleans (8-1). The associated OCaml implementation is `fullsimple`.


11 Simple Extensions
--------------------

The systems studied in this chapter are various extensions of the pure typed lambda-calculus (Figure 9-1). The associated OCaml implementation, fullsimple, includes all the extensions.
