14 Exceptions
-------------

The systems studied in this chapter are the simply typed lambda-calculus (Figure 9-1) ex-
tended with various primitives for exceptions and exception handling (Figures 14-1 and 14-2).
The OCaml implementation of the Ô¨Årst extension is fullerror. The language with exceptions
carrying values (Figure 14-3) is not implemented.
