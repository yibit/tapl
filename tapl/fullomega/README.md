==========

23 Universal Types
------------------

The system studied in most of this chapter is pure System F (Figure 23-1); the examples in §23.4 use various extensions with previously studied features. The associated OCaml implementation is fullpoly. (The examples involving pairs and lists require the fullomega checker.)

29 Type Operators and Kinding
-----------------------------

The system introduced in this chapter is the pure simply typed lambda-calculus with type operators, λω (Figure 29-1). The examples also use numbers and booleans (8-2) and universal types (23-1). The associated OCaml implementation is fullomega.

30 Higher-Order Polymorphism
----------------------------

The examples in this chapter are terms of Fω (Figure 30-1) with records, booleans, and ex-istentials (30-2). The associated OCaml implementation is fullomega. No implementation is provided for the dependent types mentioned in §30.5.
