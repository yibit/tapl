============

5 The Untyped Lambda-Calculus
------------------------------

The examples in this chapter are terms of the pure untyped lambda-calculus, λ (Figure  5-3), or of the lambda-calculus extended with booleans and arithmetic operations, λNB (3-2). The associated OCaml implementation is `fulluntyped`.

6 Nameless Representation of Terms
-----------------------------------

The system studied in this chapter is the pure untyped lambda-calculus, λ (Figure  5-3). The associated OCaml implementation is `fulluntyped`.

7 An ML Implementation of lambda-calculus
------------------------------------------

The system studied in most of this chapter is the pure untyped lambda-calculus (Figure 5- 3).  The  associated implementation is `untyped`.  The `fulluntyped` implementation includes extensions such as numbers and booleans.
