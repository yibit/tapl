23 Universal Types
------------------

The system studied in most of this chapter is pure System F (Figure 23-1); the examples in ยง23.4 use various extensions with previously studied features. The associated OCaml implementation is fullpoly. (The examples involving pairs and lists require the fullomega checker.)

24 Existential Types
--------------------

The system studied in most of this chapter is System F (Figure 23-1) with existentials (24-1). The examples also use records (11-7) and numbers (8-2). The associated OCaml implementation is fullpoly.
