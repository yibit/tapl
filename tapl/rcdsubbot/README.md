15 Subtyping
-------------

The calculus studied in this chapter is ฮป<: , the simply typed lambda-calculus with subtyping (Figure 15-1) and records (15-3); the corresponding OCaml implementation is `rcdsubbot`. (Some of the examples also use numbers; `fullsub` is needed to check these.)

16 Metatheory of Subtyping
---------------------------

The calculus studied in this chapter is the simply typed lambda-calculus with subtyping (Figure 15-1) and records (15-3). The corresponding OCaml implementation is `rcdsub bot`. ยง16.3 also deals with booleans and conditionals (8-1); the OCaml implementation for this section is [joinsub]. ยง16.4 extends the discussions to Bot; the corresponding implementation is bot.
